Responsys java client sample code on axis2 framework
=============

responsys java client code axis2

This project is to help developers get around common problems found while trying to implement client applications that interact with the Responsys api.

Check the documentation folder for a setup pdf that walks you through how to create a standalone java/eclipse project using the axis2 apache webservices library.

The samples will illustrate how to make the calls, as the api documentation is vague.
